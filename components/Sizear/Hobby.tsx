            I prioritize spending quality time with my family to create
            meaningful moments. Outside of these moments, I enjoy reading a wide
            range of books, including autobiographies, travel literature,
            columns, and novels. Additionally, my profession allows me to travel
            both nationally and internationally, often with my family. As an
            Anthropology student, I am naturally inclined to observe people and
            their behaviors to gain a deeper understanding of life. Writing
            non-fiction is both my passion and a cherished hobby.
